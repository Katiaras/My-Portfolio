---------------Character Regocnition ----------------------

Aim of is to create a library, with implementation, that could 
be used for character recognition from images. 

Technologies Used: Python, OpenCV (library), Numpy (library). 

Guide-lines: the implementation takes part in two phases...
1. Training - the machine on a dataset. (Supervised Machine Learning).
The training result is stored in two file; one with the classification, and one with 
the image representation of the character.  

2. Testing - the machine learning on new dataset, an new image.

The comparison code for the classification is KNN algorithm.
